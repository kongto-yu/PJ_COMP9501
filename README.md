## Introduction
Welcome to the Radio2Speech Project! It is a groundbreaking system that utilizes radio frequency (RF) signals for reconstructing high-quality speech from loudspeakers using mmWave Radar technology. Unlike conventional microphones, this innovative approach is uniquely resistant to noise and capable of penetrating soundproof materials.

## Key features
Advanced Technology: Radio2Speech represents a major leap forward compared to previous techniques, which were confined to simple single-tone music or unclear speech recovery.

RadioGAN: At the core of this system is RadioGAN, adept at accurately reconstructing speech in the time-frequency domain from RF signals, even within a limited frequency range.

Neural Vocoder Integration: The system incorporates a neural vocoder for speech waveform synthesis from the estimated time-frequency representation, effectively bypassing the need to rely on phase data contaminated by noise.

## Performance:
Versatile Efficacy: Extensive evaluations of Radio2Speech have showcased its impressive performance across various settings â€“ from serene to noisy environments and even in soundproof scenarios.

Comparable to Microphones: In quiet environments, Radio2Speech has demonstrated performance on par with traditional microphones, marking a significant achievement.

## How to Run the Code
To begin training the Radio2Speech model, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash train_cgan.sh
```

This command will initiate the model's training process using the predefined configurations and datasets.
